total=num1+num2

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if num % 2 ==0
then print "even"
else print "odd"

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

array(num1,num2,num3,num4,num5)
avg=average(array)
min=min(array) & max=max(array)
print(avg)&"average of the array of 5 numbers"
print(min)&"the smallest of the array of 5 numbers"
print(max)&"the largest of the array of 5 numbers"
